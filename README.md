- How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

One can establish an understanding of the initial requirements of a project by understanding what a user wants to accomplish through a given interaction with the project. This interaction based on a user's individual persepctive can be used to create "user stories" that represent the needs of a user, within that project, to accomplish the outlined task within the story.

- How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

In my current role as a software developer, we mostly use some weird combination of waterfall and agile with mixed results at best. I would personally prefer to adopt more agile practices such as estimation meetings for features, an actual sprint that we try to follow over a period of a week and a half to two weeks, a sprint retrospective meeting, and actually having some acting as the designated Scrum Master and/or agile lead as opposed to each of the developers on my team, myself included, filling in those holes as we go along. 

- What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To me, being a good team member is synonymous with being a good communicator. If one is able to communicate effectively, can collaborate with others in and outside of the team, and is always excited/engaged by taking on new technical challenges in a way that helps team morale then that person is a good team  member in software development.
